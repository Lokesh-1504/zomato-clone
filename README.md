## Project Overview
This project is a Zomato-like food delivery web application where users can explore, filter, and order food from a wide variety of restaurants. The platform allows users to filter restaurants by country, search within a specific radius, and choose based on their preferred cuisine. Built with modern web technologies, this application aims to deliver a user-friendly experience for browsing and ordering food online.

## Features Explanation
1. Country-Wise Filter
This filter allows users to choose restaurants based on their country of residence. Users can select from a list of supported countries, and the application will display only the restaurants available in that country.
